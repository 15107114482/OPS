Simulation Results
==================

This directory contains

1) Simulation results (crunched results from the original logfiles), located in
`results_parsers_phase2`
2) Matlab / Octave Scripts to create the graphs used in this paper out of those
results, located in `matlab_scripts`. The main scripts are `nodes.m` and
`cache.m`. Those create the output graphs. The other scripts (`ep__*` and
`kee__*` import the data from the corresponding `*.xls` files from the
`results_parsers_phase2` directory. The scripts were tested with Octave 4.4.0
and Matlab R2016a. Octave requires the following plugins: `io`, `signal`
3) The output generated by the Matlab scripts, located in `matlab_graphs`
