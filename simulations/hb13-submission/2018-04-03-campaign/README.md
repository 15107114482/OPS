# 2018-04-03-campaign

This simulation campaign was done to determine the initial confidence interval computations (using Student-t) for the following sets of simulations.

- Epidemic and Keetchi using random application with generation intervals 15s, 60s, 250s, 500s
- Epidemic and Keetchi using random mobility with number of nodes [250:250:2000]
- Epidemic and Keetchi using random mobility with cache sizes 500kB, 1MB, 3MB
